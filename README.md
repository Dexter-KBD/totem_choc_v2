This is the **aluminum CNC version** of the Totem that uses **Kailh Choc V2** switches.

For PCB information, please visit: [https://github.com/vinivicici/totem_chv2](https://github.com/vinivicici/totem_chv2)

Be sure to read the README carefully.

There is a hole for the **Xiao BLE** to communicate.

Without this hole, the BLE signal cannot transmit properly from inside the housing.

If you’re concerned about dust entering, you can cover the hole with tape on the outside.

The bottom of the base features engraved logos.

On the left is the original Totem logo, and on the right is a logo inspired by my Korean nickname.

If you don’t like them, you can remove them yourself in Fusion 360 before placing your order.

This is a height comparison with the original Totem that uses **Choc V1** switches.

With the added bottom plate and the slightly taller V2 switches, it is approximately **1 mm higher**.

I cut and inserted the foam from **Taobao**.

The original plan was to fit all of it, but there wasn’t enough space between the PCB and the bottom plate.

Only **one sheet** fits.

It’s not absolutely necessary to include it, but I’m attaching the DWG files I used.

Choc V2 uses **MX stems (cross-shaped)** but follows **Choc spacing**, so there are no commercially available keycaps for it.
I used **KLP Lame MX Stem Choc Spacing** keycaps:

[https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps/tree/master/STEP/MX%20Stem%20%2B%20Choc%20Size](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps/tree/master/STEP/MX%20Stem%20%2B%20Choc%20Size)

All the keycap files are shared at the link above.

The files in my folder are grouped into **nine pieces** for easier printing at JLC3DP.

The specifications of each keycap are the same as the originals.

Since it’s aluminum, you must machine screw holes in the top case.

Be sure to add threaded holes for M2 screws.

If you skip this step, the parts cannot be fastened with screws.



Finally, this modeling project was carried out by me personally.

There may be minor issues that do not meet your standards, but I cannot take responsibility for them.

Also, I have never tried 3D printing this with materials other than aluminum CNC, so I cannot say whether it will work properly with FDM or resin.

If you decide to try it, sharing your results would be greatly appreciated.
